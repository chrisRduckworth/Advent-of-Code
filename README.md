# üéÑ Advent of Code 2023
All solutions written in python. Tests written using pytest. Put your input for a day in `inputs/day_n.txt`. To run:
```
python day_n.py
```
A few of the solutions are brute-force (*cough day 5 cough*) and might take a while, but mostly they should run in reasonable time.

I'm really pleased with how I did, I got much further than I expected (originally I'd have been pleased with day 10) and I learnt a lot about pytest and using algorithms efficiently.
